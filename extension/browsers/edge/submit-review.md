This is a devtool for a graphql client named Apollo Client.
Apollo client: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/

This tool will only create a devtool page in case the website is using apollo client library as a state mangement. Otherwise it won't create a devtool page.

This is the repo for this extension: https://github.com/jpsahoo14/apollo-inspector-ui

This extension is not for general public, so can't be tested without a website using apollo client.

This extension has also been published to chrome store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/apollo-inspector/onjpbondiicnaofbdmhmjobnlchakpan
