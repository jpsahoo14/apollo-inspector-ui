Apollo Inspector is a Chrome extension designed for the open-source GraphQL client, Apollo Client.

This tool is particularly useful for debugging various issues related to GraphQL operations in Apollo Client.

## What kind of issues can be debugged using the tool

1. Helps figuring out `unwanted operations` being fired in render phase
2. Help in figuring out the reasons for `multiple re-renders` of the same watch query​
3. Help figuring out issues with `conflicting queries​`
4. Shows field name in case `missing field error`
5. Detailed time info lets you figure out if queries are being fired in `Waterfall model` or not.
6. Helps figuring out if `data is taking too much time` to get written to cache.
7. Shows why an operation failed

## How to use

To enable the Apollo Inspector extension to work, follow these instructions:
1. Single Apollo Client Instance: If your web app has a single instance of Apollo Client, attach it to the `__APOLLO_CLIENT__` variable on the window object.

2. Multiple Apollo Client Instances: If your web app has multiple instances of Apollo Client, create an array (ClientObject[]) containing all these instances and attach it to the `__APOLLO_CLIENTS__` variable on the window object.
